# DNANexus Apps and Applets

DNANexus offers a range of tools and apps to support genomic data analysis and management. In particular, The Swiss Army Knife app is a multi-purpose tool that can be used to run Docker images of your choice, and it comes with familiar tools such as plink2, REGENIE, QCTool, BOLT-LMM, etc.&#x20;

DNANexus allows users to develop and share their apps using open-source tools and programming languages, making it a highly customizable platform for genomic data analysis. DNANexus tools and apps provide users with a wide range of options for managing and analyzing their genomic data in a flexible and scalable environment.

The Jupyter notebook we explored earlier is also a DNANexus app. Unfortunately, DNANexus only provides RStudio Workbench to UK Biobank Research Platforms. We will create our own RStudio Server app instead.
