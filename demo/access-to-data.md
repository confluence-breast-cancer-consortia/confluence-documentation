# Access to data

In DNANexus, a project is a container that organizes data, analyses, and resources related to a specific research project. Projects in DNANexus allow users to: 1. Organize data; 2. Collaborate; 3. Manage workflows and 4. Monitor progress.&#x20;

For the Confluence project on DNANexus, we have two types of projects, namely, data projects and analysis projects, as shown in the figure below. Data projects are where the individual-level data under the governance of the data coordinating centers. Analysis projects are where the analysis computation happens and where the results of the analysis sit.  &#x20;

This simple [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/confluence-breast-cancer-consortia/dnanexus\_demo/blob/main/notebooks/bash\_demo.ipynb) shows how to copy data from the _**demo\_data**_ project into the virtual machine hosting JupyterLab, run the analysis, and copy the results to the _**demo\_analysis**_ project.  &#x20;
