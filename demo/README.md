# Demo

The _**objective**_ of this DNANexus tutorial/demo is to provide an introduction to the DNANexus platform, including account setup and project management. Additionally, we will demonstrate running DNANexus tools, as well as using R and command line tools to analyze their data.&#x20;

We also want to use this opportunity to test collaboration features within DNANexus, such as how to get access to data, transfer results back to the projects, and share analysis results with others.&#x20;
