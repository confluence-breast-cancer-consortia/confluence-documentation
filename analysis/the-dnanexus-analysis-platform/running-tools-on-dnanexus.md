# Running tools on DNANexus

DNANexus provides detailed instructions on how to run its apps [here](https://documentation.dnanexus.com/user/running-apps-and-workflows/running-apps-and-applets). Of these, the most versatile and flexible tool is the _**app-swiss-army-knife**_ app. You can use it to run any program that has a public Docker image.&#x20;
