# Managing data and results on DNAnexus

A project on DNAnexus is a collaborative workspace where users can store, analyze, and share data using a range of tools and features provided by the platform. Projects  also include access control features that allow users to specify which individuals or groups can access their data and at what level of permissions. &#x20;

For the Confluence project, we will have two types of projects. The “data” projects contain the individual level data governed by the data cooridinating centers; whereas the “analysis concept” projects are where the analysis happen and results are stored.  For the analysis projects, we recommend that intermediate and final results  are organized into folders and subfolders to facilitate data management and collaboration with other users; and the analysis code are versioned and committed to the confluence GitHub repositories. &#x20;
