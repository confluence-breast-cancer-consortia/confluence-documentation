# GitHub Code Contributing Guidelines

## Guidelines:

* **Repository Structure**: Each analysis or pipeline should have its own GitHub repository. The repository should be organized clearly and consistently, with a README file explaining the purpose and contents of the repository.

* **Code Quality**: All code in the repositories should be well-documented and adhere to best practices for code quality, such as proper use of version control, commenting, and testing.

* **Data Management**: Confluence individual-level data should not be stored on GitHub. 

* **Commit Messages**: Commit messages should be clear, concise, and descriptive, providing context for the changes made in each commit. We recommend following the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

* **Issue Tracking**: Issue tracking should be used to track the progress of their analytical work and collaborate with others.

* **Pull Requests**: Pull requests should be used to suggest changes and provide feedback on each other's work.

* **Continuous Integration**: Where possible, we should set up continuous integration workflows that automate testing and deployment of code changes. This helps to ensure that our code remains stable and working as expected.
