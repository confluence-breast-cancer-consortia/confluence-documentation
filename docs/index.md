# The Confluence project

Welcome to the Confluence Project GitHub organization! We are developing a large research resource to uncover breast cancer genetics through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in diverse populations.

Broad scientific aims include:

* To discover susceptibility loci and advance knowledge of etiology of breast cancer overall and by subtypes.
* To develop polygenic risk scores and integrate them with known risk factors for personalized risk assessment for breast cancer overall and by subtypes.
* To discover loci for breast cancer prognosis, long-term survival, response to treatment, and second breast cancer.
